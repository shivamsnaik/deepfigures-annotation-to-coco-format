# Convert DeepFigures annotation files to COCO format
This repo contains code files that can be used to extract the standard COCO format annotations from [Deep Figures - Extracting Scientific Figures with Distantly Supervised Neural Networks](https://deepai.org/publication/extracting-scientific-figures-with-distantly-supervised-neural-networks).

The class COCODataset contains various methods which allow the user to read, display, convert the json files into coco format. Later, you can choose to store the coco json files into your disk based on the input you give.
